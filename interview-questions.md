# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props are essentially vessels for passing information from a parent file to a child file. Data is exchanged with props in order to properly execute functions.

  Researched answer: They are used for passing data from one component to another. The data is only passed from the parent to the child, which is called uni-directional flow.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event is anything that happens within the webpage such as loading, clicks, scroll overs, scaling window sizes and so on.

  Researched answer: What occurs when HTML is interacted with through user clicks on the UI. Javascript is executed (functions) when this happens.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: OOP is more focused around making real world objects connect through code such as the car project we worked on. Listing out each individual object to give them a purpose and then assigning different attributes to them in order to make a program run. It is generally a more lengthy style of coding, however, it can be executed just as quickly as functional programming. Functional programming is more oriented toward equation type programming that uses minimal lines of code in order to execute a function.

  Researched answer: Functional programming allows for easily managable and resusable code that is primarily used in front end spaces. OOP is more frequently used for back ends due to being able to give objects to the functional programming at the front.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: A float is simply a number that includes a decimal-not a whole number such as 7.3. An integer would simply be 7, 8, 9 and so on.

  Researched answer: I didn't find any further information for this.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: I believe this means that you do not have to console log in order to get the code to run within your terminal.

  Researched answer: Ruby is capable of returning the last executed instruction in the code even without having it specifically called upon, which is called an implicit return.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: Used in OOP it is a variable that coincides with a class and has a separate copy of it

2. PostgreSQL: Open source database that is object-relational. It uses SQL

3. Ruby on Rails: Provides a structure for web pages through the use of a server

4. ORM: Object-relational mapping. Technique for converting data between incompatible systems by using OOP.

5. Active Record: An architectural pattern or anti-pattern. Stores in-memory object data in relational databases.
